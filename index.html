            Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
            acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and
            habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
            storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently
            takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can
            also educate themselves.

          Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition
          of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational
          methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and
          directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance
          of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education
          can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that
          has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
          considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called
          pedagogy.Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages
          such as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school
          and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions,
          education is compulsory up to a certain age.

          Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of
          literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw
          European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences
          spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought
          back new ideas from other civilizations â€“ as with the Jesuit China
          missions who played a significant role in the transmission of
          knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating
          works from Europe like Euclid's Elements for Chinese scholars and the
          thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. The Enlightenment saw
          the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe. Much of
          modern traditional Western and Eastern education is based on the
          Prussian education system.[13] In most countries today, full-time
          education, whether at school or otherwise, is compulsory for all
          children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of
          compulsory education, combined with population growth, UNESCO has
          calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal
          education than in all of human history thus far.

          Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
          knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In
          pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
          imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one
          generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge
          beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal
          education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the
          Middle Kingdom.[2] Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the
          Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607 Plato founded
          the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in
          Europe.[3] The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE,
          became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient
          Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd
          century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy
          and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476
